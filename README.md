# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with React.Js for the 'Client' directory and Node.js for the directory.

Open two terminals. One on 'Client'  and the second on 'Server'.
If it's the first time you work on these, you have to install on both directoy the node_modules with :

### `npm install`

This will install the dependencies necessary for the proper functioning of the application.

## Available Scripts

In the 'Client' (frontend) directory, you can run :

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

In the 'Server' (backend) directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000] to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in your IDE terminal.
